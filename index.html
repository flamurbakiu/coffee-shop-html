          <h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
          <p>
            Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of
            raw coffee beans into roasted coffee products. This process is what
            produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green
            coffee beans to change in taste. Many coffee roasters determine the
            level of roast by eye, assessing the color of the beans to determine
            the desired roast-level.

              Green coffee as it arrives at the dock. They can be stored for
              approximately 12-18 months in a climate controlled environment

            <p>
              Moderate light brown, but still mottled in appearance. A preferred
              roast for some specialty roasters, highlights origin
              characteristics as well as complex acidity.

              Medium brown, common for most specialty coffee. Good for tasting

              Moderate dark brown with light surface oil, more bittersweet,
              caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any
              origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this
              level.
